# AdaptiveAlgorithm
This C# code includes classes that resemble the adaptive game-theoretical algorithm. This algorithm observes a game and discovers patterns in the opponent's behavior. Then it uses this knowledge to adapt the mixed strategy. It also includes a complete simulation of the VDB problem with the algorithm integrated.
